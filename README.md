# Z-TCP-Protocol-Stack
I have studied FreeRTOS-TCP/IP for almost three months,But I still don't understand some of its details, 
Yep,that,they may have spended several years for finishing this protocol stack,
It is impossible for me to master all its essence in a short time.
To have a better understand of TCP/IP,To improve my programming skill,
I decided to write a TCP/IP stack,which has lesser function,But has the main functions.
